# BigInteger_uni

This is a small c++ project for university. Please do not use in real projects, there exists better, faster and more reliable versions of this.

This project is an implementation of BigInteger in Java. With this implementation, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide and compare arbitrarily big integers. Usage is presented in main.cpp as test cases. 
As a way of storing these integers, BigInteger uses array of decimal digits represented as int. Arithmetic operations are implemented similarly to how you would do these operation on paper, with some slight optimizations. One thing to note is that as you do operations on these numbers, their array size will grow, as all operations allocate enough memory to handle worst case scenarios (multiplication of two 20digit numbers will always allocate array of 40digits) and currently there's no way to shrink these arrays.

Also dividing by 0 returns 0 remainder 0, because we were forbidden to throw exceptions

Usage:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "BigInteger.h"

int main() {
  BigInteger a(133245), b(2101275), c(-927159);
  BigInteger d = a*b+c;
  BigInteger div = (b/c).result;
  BigInteger remainder = (b/c).remainder; // Not too smart implementation but uni requires
  
  std::cout << d.toString() << std::endl; //279983460216
  std::cout << div.toString() << std::endl; //-2
  std::cout << remainder.toString() << std::endl; //-246957
  
  return 0;
}
```


Plans for the future (unlikely to be implemented):
  * Fix division so it returns normal number instead of both remainder and result
  * Add exception to division by 0
  * Make arrays automatically smaller for numbers like '00000000000245'
  * Migrate to std::array or std::vector (again, uni constraints)
  * Add power operation
  * Add ability to cast back to int smaller numbers
  * Make operators work with built-in c++ types
